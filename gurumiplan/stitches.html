            <p>Part of the beauty of amigurumi is the simplicity of it. Crocheting in general can seem like a daunting, difficult hobby to get into, but amigurumi crochet generally uses only one or two types of stitches that are very easy to learn. You will almost always use the continuous round method, which means that you complete a lot of your work on one hook using one ball of yarn. This makes it even easier for beginners. This means that you do not have to buy a ton of different fancy and expensive supplies. Most beginners can start by just buying a small ball of yarn and a hook for just a few dollars!</p>
