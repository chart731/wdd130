            <p>I started getting into amigurumi crochet when I was about 13 years old. My go to has always been chenille yarn, although it can be difficult to use as a beginner. I have a soft spot for making octopi, but part of what I love about amigurumi is how creative you can be with it. You can branch out and make any sort of animal, character, or creature that you can think of!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have a few pictures here of some of the octopi that I have made, along with a pig that I decided to make on a whim. This is just an example of the different things that amigurumi allows you to do!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I prefer using colorful or pastel yarns, as it always gives the stitches that extra pop! Part of the charm of Amigurumi is having each stitch be so visible. You can easily tell that each creation is handmade, and that a lot of effort was put into it.</p>

            <p>I made both of these with the continuous round method, which is part of why amigurumi can be so simple, yet so adorable! The stitches end up so bubbly and round looking. You can experiment and use different stitch types once you get used to the amigurumi style, but using the continuous round method can help you to get started!</p>
            <br>
            <p>As far as uses go for your creations, I personally find myself hoarding them throughout the year and then giving them out as presents. It is so rewarding to be able to create personalized, adorable gifts for friends and loved ones!</p>
