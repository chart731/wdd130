      <h3>Amigurumi Fun!</h3>
      <p>
        Amigurumi is a type of crochet that uses round, bubbly stitches to create cute animals, characters, or creatures! It is a simple, beginner-friendly type of crochet that is easy to get into and can be very rewarding. You can make anything from giant stuffed animals to tiny keychains or car charms. It is also a unique and yet helpful skill to have; I find myself whipping out a creation or two for a last-minute birthday gift or Christmas present more times than I would care to admit! 
        The picture here shows just a few adorable examples of what amigurumi crochet allows you to create. Another part of the beauty of amigurumi is how inexpensive it can be. You can thrift materials or even buy new ones for just a few dollars. It is an easy, cheap, and rewarding hobby to get into. As you get more into it and advance your skills, you can start to make your favorite characters from your favorite games or television shows! I love doing this and then displaying them in my home for myself and others to see.

      <h3>Stitches and Patterns</h3>
      <p>
        Part of the beauty of amigurumi is the simplicity of it. Crocheting in general can seem like a daunting, difficult hobby to get into, but amigurumi crochet generally uses only one or two types of stitches that are very easy to learn. You will almost always the continuous round method, which means that you complete a lot of your work on one hook using one ball of yarn. This makes it even easier for beginners. This means that you do not have to buy a ton of different fancy and expensive supplies. Most beginners can start by just buying a small ball of yarn and a hook for just a few dollars!
        The community for amigurumi crochet is very helpful and welcoming, as well, which helps beginners to get into it. There are hundreds of free patterns, online video tutorials, online crochet groups, and many other resources that can help you at the start of your crochet career.
        Most patterns will take anywhere from a few hours to a day to complete, so you will be able to have the results of your work and efforts in no time! This also allows you to practice and get better at a quick pace.

      <h3>Personal Creations</h3>
      <p>
        I started getting into amigurumi crochet when I was about 13 years old. My go to has always been chenille yarn, although it can be difficult to use as a beginner. I have a soft spot for making octopi, but part of what I love about amigurumi is how creative you can be with it. You can branch out and make any sort of animal, character, or creature that you can think of! I have a few pictures here of some of the octopi that I have made, along with a pig that I decided to make on a whim. This is just an example of the different things that amigurumi allows you to do! 
        I made both of these with the continuous round method, which is part of why amigurumi can be so simple, yet so adorable! The stitches end up so bubbly and round looking. You can experiment and use different stitch types once you get used to the amigurumi style, but using the continuous round method can help you to get started!
        As far as uses go for your creations, I personally find myself hoarding them throughout the year and then giving them out as presents. It is so rewarding to be able to create personalized, adorable gifts for friends and loved ones!
