            <p> Amigurumi is a type of crochet that uses round, bubbly stitches to create cute animals, characters, or creatures! It is a simple, beginner-friendly type of crochet that is easy to get into and can be very rewarding. You can make anything from giant stuffed animals to tiny keychains or car charms. It is also a unique and yet helpful skill to have; I find myself whipping out a creation or two for a last-minute birthday gift or Christmas present more times than I would care to admit!</p>

            <p>The picture here shows just a few adorable examples of what amigurumi crochet allows you to create. Another part of the beauty of amigurumi is how inexpensive it can be. You can thrift materials or even buy new ones for just a few dollars. It is an easy, cheap, and rewarding hobby to get into. As you get more into it and advance your skills, you can start to make your favorite characters from your favorite games or television shows! I love doing this and then displaying them in my home for myself and others to see. </p>
