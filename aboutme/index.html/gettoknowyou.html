    <h2>Emma Bateman</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Emma Bateman. I'm currently studying accounting, with a minor in CIT. I'm originally from 
        Joseph, Oregon, a tiny town with about 1,000 people. I was homeschooled most of my life, and I have loved this new experience 
        of going to college and meeting so many new people. I am the second youngest of six girls, and the second one to go to college,
        so it is a relatively new experience in our family too.
    </p>
    <p>I'm hoping to graduate with a BSA, and then I plan to move to Seattle, Washington to be with my sisters that live there. I want to 
        start my own family someday, and I'm excited for the future! I'm hoping that my accounting degree helps me to be more flexible with
        where I can live and what I can do for a career.
    </p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church since I was born, and my favorite scriptures have always been Isaiah 53:3-5. I hope to learn a lot
        in this class and look forward to meeting you all!
    </p>
